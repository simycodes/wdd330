                    <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h2>

                    <article>
                      <h3><em>Errors</em></h3>
                      <p>
                        Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused
                        by one of the following:<br>
                        System error ― there is a problem with the system or external devices with which the
                        program is interacting.
                        Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could
                        even be as simple as a typo.
                        User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to 
                        handle.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Exceptions</h3>
                      <p>
                        An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
                        program to deal with the error. For example, trying to call a method that is
                        nonexistent will result in a reference error that raises an exception, as you can see
                        in the example below when we try to call the mythical unicorn() function:<br>
                        unicorn();<br>
                        << ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method
                         calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It is often not just a single
                        function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from
                        the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method 
                        that started the sequence. 
                      </p>

                      <h3>Warnings</h3>
                      <p>
                        A warning can occur if there is an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the 
                        program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. 
                        This might sound good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the 
                        warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.Example<br>
                        pi = 3.142; << JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable
                      </p>

                      <h3>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h3>
                      <p>
                       A programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any
                       errors can be identified and fixed quickly. In production, a ninja programmer should
                      try to make the code fail gracefully (although not completely silently ― we still 
                       need to know there’s an error), so the user experience is not affected, if possible. This is achieved by making sure exceptions are caught and dealt with, and code is tested rigorously.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Strict Mode and Linting Tools</h4>
                      <p>
                        <b>Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file</b>
                        Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated
                        features.Increasing the chance of errors might seem like a bad idea at first, but it is much
                        better to spot errors early on, rather than have them cause problems later.
                        Modules-pieces of code that are in strict mode by default, so the 'use strict' declaration
                        is not required.
                        Writing code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows
                        conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used.<br>

                        <b>Linting tools such as JS Lint,JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.</b>
                        They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and 
                        will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is 
                        indented.
                        Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide. This is particularly
                        useful when you are working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows the same 
                        conventions.<br><br>
                        It's possible to add a linting tool as a text-editor plugin; this will then highlight any
                        sloppy code as you type. Another option is to use an online linting tool that allows 
                        you to simply paste onto a page for feedback. <b>Another option is to install linting 
                        software on your computer using npm. This can then be run as part of your workflow.</b>
                        Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it 
                        will be more consistent and less likely to have problems.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Debugging in the Browser</h4>
                      <p>        
                        Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then
                        dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always
                        where it originated, so you will need to run through the program to see what is 
                        happening at different stages of its execution.<br>
                        When doing this, it can be useful to create what are known as breakpoints, which halt
                        the progress of the code and allow us to view the value of different variables at that
                        point in the program.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Alert and Console Methods for Debugging</h4>
                      <p>                     
                        The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at 
                        certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until OK
                        is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us 
                        check the value of variables at that point to see if they are what we expect them to be.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Using alerts for debugging was the only option in the past, but JavaScript development 
                        has progressed since then and their use is discouraged for debugging purposes today.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a number of 
                       methods for logging information and debugging. It's not officially part of the
                       ECMAScript specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers and Node.js
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in 
                        your code that will pause it at certain points. You can then see the values of all 
                        the variables at those points and modify them. This can be very useful when trying
                        to track down bugs. 
                      </p>

                      <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
                      <p>
                        If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block.
                        This will run the code inside the block(try) as normal, but if an exception occurs it will
                        pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is ideal in
                         development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. In production, however, it
                        will appear as if the program has crashed,hence the need to use try and catch.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Implementing try and catch makes it
                        possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be 
                        hidden from users, but still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately
                         ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running.
