                      <h3><em>Client-side form validation</em></h3>
                      <p>
                        Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form 
                        controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form
                        validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth 
                        in the various form controls. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the
                        server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side validation is too easy
                        to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                         Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation 
                         done on the server is called server-side validation.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Why Validate Data</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work 
                          properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is 
                          omitted altogether.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords
                            makes it easier to protect their account information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse 
                            unprotected forms to damage the application. 
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <h4>Built-in form validation</h4>
                      <p>
                        This is done by using validation attributes on form elements. 
                        These validation attributes include required, minlength and maxlength,min and max,
                        type,pattern and regular expressions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If the data entered in a form field follows all of the rules specified by the above
                        attributes, it is considered valid. If not, it is considered invalid.
                      </p>

                      <h4>The Constraint Validation API</h4>
                      <p>
                        Customizing these error messages is one of the most common use cases of the constraint validation API.
                      </p>

                       <h3><em>Using the Fetch API</em></h3>
                       <p>
                        <b>
                            The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts
                            of the protocol, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch()
                            method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across
                            the network.
                        </b>
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        A basic fetch request is really simple to set up. Have a look at the following code:
                          <pre>
                            fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
                            .then((response) => response.json())
                            .then((data) => console.log(data));
                          </pre>

                          Here we are fetching a JSON file across the network and printing it to the console.
                          The simplest use of fetch() takes one argument — the path to the resource you want 
                          to fetch — and does not directly return the JSON response body but instead returns 
                          a promise that resolves with a Response object.<br>
                          The Response object, in turn, does not directly contain the actual JSON response body
                          but is instead a representation of the entire HTTP response. So, to extract the JSON
                          body content from the Response object, we use the json() method, which returns a 
                          second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON.
                       </p>

                       <h4>Supplying request options</h4>
                       <p>
                         The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that 
                         allows you to control a number of different settings:
                       </p>
