                <h2>Local Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    Local storage in JS applications is used in remembering the userâ€™s information or 
                    to keep track of the changes that a user makes to a JS web page so that these 
                    changes can be there again when the user access the web app again after the app 
                    has been closed or stopped.Usually when an application has been stopped
                    all that it was working on is gone without being stored unless if the 
                    application has mechanism in place to save all the changes it has been.
                </p>

                <h3><em>Storing user data</em></h3>
                <p>
                    With JS applications there is an inbuilt object called localstorage that is used
                    to store user data without having to connect to databases such as mongo database
                    or relational databases. All the data is stored by localStorage object and is
                     attached to the browser that was used by the user when inserting or changing
                    data on the JS application. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this mechanism in place, a user may access the JS application any 
                    other time even after closing the browser and he will find the data and
                    changes he made just like they were before closing the application.<br>

                    The localStorage object has 2 main methods that it uses to store JS app
                    data and to also retrieve the data.<br><br>
                    -- setItem() method is used to store user data locally.<br>
                    -- getItem() method is used to retrieve the data stored in the JS local storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>NOTE:</b> The setItem accepts two arguments (a pair), the key
                     (first argument) and the corresponding value (second argument). 
                     You use the key to get access to the value that needs to be 
                     used/displayed.<br><br>

                     <b>Example of storing user data using LocalStorage object</b><br>
                     localStorage.setItem(storyName, storyHTML);<br><br>

                     <b>Example of accessing and displaying user data using LocalStorage object</b><br>
                     var storyHTML = localStorage.getItem(storyName);<br>
                     console.log(storyHTML)
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h5>Question</h5>
                    <p>
                       Does the local storage keep user data even after the users browers'
                       has been cleared of all browsing data.
                    </p>
