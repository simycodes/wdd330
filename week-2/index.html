                       <h3><em>JS Variables</em></h3>
                       <p>
                        <b>Primitives</b><br>
                        string,
                        number,
                        boolean,
                        null,
                        symbol (ES6),
                        undefined<br>
                        <b>Objects</b><br>
                          object literals,
                          Arrays,
                          Functions,
                          Classes,
                          basically everything that is not a primitive!
                       </p>

                       <h3>const and let</h3>
                       <p>
                          The keyword const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.
                          <b>Variables have to be declared before they can be used.</b>
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          If the variable references a non-primitive data type, such as an array, function or
                          object, then using const will not make it immutable. This means the underlying data
                          inside the object can change (known as mutating the object).<br>
                          Even if you use const to declare a variable, non-primitive data types can still be mutated later in the program.<br>
                          Check Example in the JS variables program attached.

                        <h3><em>Variable Scope</em></h3>
                        <p>
                          Using const and let to declare variables means they are block 
                          scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are 
                          declared in.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Global Scope</h4>
                        <p>
                          Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope. 
                          This means it is accessible everywhere in the program. 
                          While this may seem to be a good idea at first, it is not considered good practice.
                          <br>
                          A variable having a global scope means its available inside and outside the other lower
                          level scopes,but local variables in these scopes have a higher precedence than the
                          global variables.<br>
                          Defining a variable in a scope without using let or const makes that variable global
                          and can be accessed anywhere. { a = 10 }
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Local Scope</h4>
                        <p>
                           Blocks '{ --this space here-- }' can be used to create a local scope. 
                           This means that any variables defined inside a block using the let or 
                           const will only be available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that bloc
                           <br>
                           If let or const are not used, the variable will have global scope and be available outside the block. 
                        </p>

                        <h3><em>Template Literals</em></h3>
                        <p> 
                          Template Literals allows the use both types of quote mark within the string
                          and interpolation of JavaScript code. This means that a JavaScript 
                          expression can be inserted inside a string and the result will be displayed.<br>
                         <b>`She said, "It's Me!"`</b><br>
                         <b>const age = 39;<br>
                          `I will be ${ age + 1 } next year`;
                         </b>
                        </p>

                        <h3><em>JS Reserved Words</em></h3>
                        <p>
                          The following words are reserved for use by the JavaScript language and cannot be 
                          used to name variables (or function parameters and object properties 
                          that appear in later chapters):<br><br>
                          abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield
                          <br>
                          These words are reserved because many of them are used by the language itself.
                        </p>

                        <h3><em>Converting Between Strings and Numbers </em></h3>
                        <p>
                          <b>Converting Strings to Numbers</b>
                          The best way to change a string to a number is to use the Number() method. <br>

                          <b>Converting Numbers to Strings</b>
                          The preferred way of changing a number to a string is to use the String() function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <b>Parsing Numbers</b>
                          There is also a useful function called parseInt() that can be used to convert a string representation of a numerical value back into a number.
                          You can specify the base of the number you are trying to convert.<br>
                          There is also a similar function called parseFloat() that converts strings into floating point decimal numbers:
                         
                        </p>
                     </article>

                     <article>
                        <h3><em>Arrays</em></h3>
                        <p>
                           <b>Arrays, sets, and maps are data structures used in JavaScript to store lists of values. </b>
                           The main array methods include Pop, Push, Shift, and Unshift
                        </p>
                        <h4>Deleting an array item</h4>
                        <p>
                           The delete operator will remove an item from an array<br>
                           <b>delete avengers[3];</b><br>
                           <em>
                              The value that was in position 3 has will be deleted from the array,
                              but the space that it occupied will still there and contain a value of
                              undefined. <br>
                              This means the array still has the same number of elements, and the
                              position can still be referenced as an index, but it will just return 
                              undefined:<br>
                              To complete;y delete the item and its position use array methods such as pop and
                              shift.
                           </em>
                        </p>

                        <h4>Destructuring Arrays</h4>
                        <p>
                           Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values out of an
                           array and presenting them as individual values.<br>
                           Destructuring allows us to assign multiple values at the same 
                           time, using arrays:<br>
                           <b>const [x, y] = [1, 2];<br>x = 1 and y = 2 outside the array</b>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Maps</h3>
                        <p>
                           They are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar 
                           to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.<br>
                           The set() method is be used to add a key and value pair to a map. The first value
                           is the key and the second is the value:<br>

                           <b>romanNumerals.set(1,'I');</b><br>

                           A map is a bit like a dictionary where you can look up a value based on the key. 
                           To look up a value, we can use the get() method:<br>
                           romanNumerals.get(4); //'IV'
                        </p>

                        <h3>for-of Loop</h3>
                        <p>
                           for-of LOOP,replaces the use of usual for loop to loop through an array<br><br>
                           let avengers2 = ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Hawkeye', 'Black Widow'];
                           <br><br>
                           for(const value of avengers2){
                              console.log(value);
                            }
                            <br>
                            Note that the variable --value-- needs to be declared using const.<br>
                            The for-of loop can also be used to loop through sets and maps
                        </p>

                     <article>
                        <h3><em>Functions</em></h3>

                        <h4>Function Expressions</h4>
                        <p>
                           Functions created by assigning an anonymous function to a variable.<br>
                           <pre>
                              const goodbye = function(){
                                 console.log('Goodbye World!');
                              };
                           </pre>
                         </p>

                         <h4>Difference Between Parameters and Arguments</h4>
                         <p>
                            Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to 
                            represent values provided for the function as an input.<br>
                            There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when 
                            the function is defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                           If a parameter is not provided as an argument when the function is invoked, the 
                           function will still be invoked, but the parameter will be given a value of undefined.<br>
                           The function returns NaN because the function cannot do the required operation with undefined. 
                         </p>

                         <p>
                           If too many arguments are provided when a function is invoked, the function will work
                            as normal and the extra arguments will be ignored.
                         </p>

                         <h4>Functions that accept any number of arguments</h4>
                         <p>
                           The rest operator ...--argument-- can be used to make a function accept any number of
                           arguments that it is given

                           <pre>
                              function mean(...values) {
                                 let total = 0;
                                 for(const value of values) {
                                     total += value;
                                 }
                                 return total/values.length;
                             }

                              mean(2,8,13); // 7.6666...
                              mean(2,8);  // 5
                           </pre>
                         </p>

                         <h4>Arrow Functions</h4>
                         <p>
                           If the main body of the function fits onto one line, so there is no need to put
                           it inside a block or explicitly use the return keyword.
                           <pre>
                              const add = (x,y) => x + y;

                              const hello = () => alert('Hello World!');

                              const tax = (salary) => {
                                 const taxable = salary - 8000;

                           <b>Hoisting</b> is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and 
                           function declarations to the top of the current scope, regardless of where they 
                           are defined.<br>
                           With hoisting, function definitions can be placed together, possibly at the 
                           end of a program, rather than having to define every function before it is used.
                         </p>

                         <h3>A Callback Function</h3>
                         <p>
                            A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.
                            Functions can be used as arguments because they are first class objects that
                            behave like any other JS object.
                            <pre>
                              function sing(song,callback) {
                                  console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`);
                                  callback();
                              }
                            </pre>
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           The callback is provided as a parameter, then invoked inside the body of the function.<br>
                           Note that the callback dance is passed as an argument without parentheses. 
                           This is because the argument is only a reference to the function. 
                           The actual callback is invoked in the body of the function, where parentheses are used.
                         </p>

                         <h3>Callback Arrow function/anonymous function</h3>
                         <p>
                           This is the most common way in which call back functions are used
                         </p>

                         <pre>
                           function sing(song) {
                              console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`);
                           }

                           //linking a callback function to a function call
                           sing('Let It Go',()=>{ 
                              console.log("I'm standing on my head.");
                           });

                         </pre>

                         <h3>Sorting Numbers in JS Functions</h3>
                         <p>
                           Numbers in JS are sorted alphabetically.Hence to sort them
                           correctly, the following callback functions are used.
                         </p>

                         <pre>
                           function numerically(a,b){
                              return a-b;
                           }

                           //for very large numbers,to remove another error that JS makes
                           function numerically2 (a,b) {
                              if (a < b) {
                                 return -1;
                              } else if (a> b) {
                                 return 1;
                              } else {
                                 return 0;
                              }
                            }

                            //Calling the functions
                            const numbers =[1,3,12,5,23,18,7];
                            console.log(numbers.sort(numerically));
                            console.log(numbers.sort(numerically2));
                         </pre>

                            <p>
                              Array methods make use of certain callback functions in order to simply
                              the working processes such as looping through an array and displaying its
                              items.<br>
                              These methods that make use of callbacks include the forEach(),map()
