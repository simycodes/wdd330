                    <h3><em>Using objects</em></h3>
                    <p>
                     Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users and orders.<br>
                     <b>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions.</b>
                     Objects are often used to keep any related information and functionality together in the same place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                     In JS there are six primitive data types (strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, and null) 
                     and the rest are referred to as objects.<br>
                     These include arrays (inbuilt object), functions, object literals
                    </p>

                    <h4>Object  Literals/Objects</h4>
                    <p>
                      <b>
                        Object literals/Objects are a distinguishing feature of the JavaScript language, 
                        as they allow objects to be created quickly without the need for defining a class.
                        Objects can inherit properties from other objects.
                     </b>

                     <pre>
                        Example of an Object

                        const superman = {
                            name: 'Superman',
                            realName: 'Clark Kent',
                            height: 75,
                            weight: 235,
                            hero: true,
                            villain: false,
                            allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'],
                            fly() {
                                return 'Up, up and away!';
                            }
                        };
                     </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Objects are accessed using the Dot notation(more common) and bracket notation.
                    </p>

                    <h3> </h3>

                    <p>
                        Objects are assigned by
                         reference. This means that if a variable is assigned to an object that already 
                         exists, it will simply point to the exact same space in memory. So any changes
                          made using either reference will affect the same object.
                    </p>

                    <pre>
                        const fruit = { 
                            name: 'Banana' 
                        };

                        const smallFruit = fruit;

                        fruit and smallFruit are basically the same.Changing the name 
                        property (Banana) of fruit to Apple will make the name property
                        of smallFruit to become Apple as well.Same will occur if changes
                        are made in smallFruit.
                    </pre>

                    <h4>Using for-in loop to Loop through Object</h4>
                    <p>
                        A for-in loop is used to carefully loop through the properties of an
                        object
                        <pre>
                            for(const propertyName in superman) {
                                console.log(propertyName + ": " + superman[propertyName]);
                            }

                            result

                            << "name: Superman"
                            << "real name: Clark Kent"
                            << "height: 75"
                            << "weight: 235"
                            << "hero: true"
                            << "villain: false"
                            << "allies: Batman,Supergirl,Superboy"
                            << "fly: function (){
                                console.log(\"Up, up and away!\");
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Converting from Objects to JSON</h4>

                    <p>
                        Objects can be converted to JSON using the stringify() method of the
                        JSON inbuilt object.<br><br>

                        JSON.stringify(superman);
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        JSON files can also be converted to Objects using the parse() method.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        JSON is used to sending data to, and receiving data from, a web server using Ajax requests
                        and when using localStorage to store data on a users machine.
                    </p>

                    <h3><em>The Date object </em></h3>
                    <p>
                      <b>Date objects contain information about dates and times.</b>
                      A constructor function is used to create a new date object using the new operator<br><br>
                      const today = new Date();
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3><em>The RegExp Object</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        A regular expression(RegExp) is a pattern that can 
                        be used to search strings for matches to the pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, say you were looking for any word ending in 'ing', 
                        you could use the regular expression /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regex can be written by placing the regular expression between forward slashes.<br>
                        / / and [a-zA-Z]+ing$ = /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/<br><br>

                        The dash represents a sequence of characters

                        Bring up anything that ends in +ing whether in lower (a-z) cases or
                        upper (A-Z)  cases
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       A RegExp can be as basic as const pattern = /JavaScript/;

<pre>
Understanding Complex RegEx

pattern2 = /[Jj][aeiou]v[aeiou]/;

-This means,first letter of word to be tested must be either J or j
-the second letter must be a vowel,either a, e, i, o, u
-the third letter must be strictly a lower case v
-The fourth letter must be a vowel,either a, e, i, o, u

pattern.test('JavaScript');
=true

pattern.test('jive');
=true

pattern.test('hello');
=false

console.log(pattern.test('Ajvakva'));
-false --The word to be tested must follow the order and position of placement
-as defined in the pattern having all stated characters at different positions is
-not enough


2.following regular expression will match anything that starts with J followed by one
or more vowels, then any letters or numbers ending in ing:

    pattern = /^J[aeiou]+\w+ing$/

\w  is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_] -Special Characters
\d is equivalent to [0-9]
\s is equivalent to [ \t\r\n\f] -match any whitespace character
^ is a modifier marks the position immediately before the first character in the string

3.The following looks for zero or more occurrences of any character, followed by an
escaped period, followed by the letters " pdf " that must come at the end of the string:

const pdf = /.*\.pdf$/;

pdf.test('chapter5.pdf');
=true

pdf.test('report.doc');
=false

Common properties include
    g sets the global property to true
    i sets the ignoreCase property to true
    m sets the multiline property to true

    pattern = /java/i
    pattern.test('JavaScript');
    =true

                    <h3><em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em></h3>
                    <p>
                      The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as 
                      a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.
                      The HTML tag is the root node, and every other part of the document is a 
                      child node of this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and 
                    enable interaction with the page by <b>adding and removing elements, changing the
                    order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.
                    </b>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       DOM involves the interaction with elements of a web page/document.<b>It is a way
                       in which JS talks with HTML elements.It has the capacity to create, access, add, 
                       remove and change the order of these HTML elements.<br>
                       It also has the capacity to change the content(InnerHTML of elements), attributes
                       and the CSS of these HTML elements (by adding & removing classes and ids on elements).</b><br>
                       Its a great tool that is used to make and improve user interactions with a web page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       We can use JavaScript to access and modify different parts of a web page using
                    a special built-in object called document.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Getting Elements from web page</h4>
                    <p>
                        Methods that access elements return a node object or a node list, 
                        which is an array-like object. These objects can then be assigned to a variable and
                        be modified or inspected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Node lists are array-like objects, but they are not arrays. You can access each 
                      item using index notation. For example, document.images[0] will return the first 
                      image in the node list of all the images in the document.<br>
                      They also have a length property( document.images.length ) , which can be used to 
                      iterate through every element using a for loop.<br>
                      for (let i=0 ; i < document.images.length ; i++) { }
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main methods used to access elements include: getElementById(),
                        getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByClassName(), querySelector(),
                        querySelectorAll()
                    </p>

                    <h4>childNodes and Children Properties</h4>
                    <p>
                      The childNodes property is a list of all the nodes that are children of
                       the node concerned.<br>
                       childNodes property returns all the nodes that are children of an element. 
                       This will include any text nodes, and since whitespace is treated as a text node, 
                       there will often be empty text nodes in this collection.<br>
                       The children property only returns any element nodes that are children of that node, 
                       so will ignore any text nodes. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Finding the Value of a Node</h4>
                    <p>
                        The value of a node (element) can be found using the textContent And
                        innerHTML properties.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Getting and Setting Attributes</h4>
                    <p>
                        All HTML elements have a large number of possible attributes such as 
                        'class', 'id', src, and 'href'. The DOM has numerous getter and setter methods 
                        that can be used to view, add, remove or modify the value of any of these attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These methods include,getAttribute('-attributeName-'), setAttribute('-attributeName-',-attributeValue-)
                    </p>

                    <h4>classList Property and toggle method</h4>
                    <p>
                        The classList property is a list of all the classes an element has. 
                        Its add method can be used to add a class to an element without overwriting any 
                        classes that already exist and its remove() method can easily remove a class from an
                        element.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The toggle() method is a very useful method that will add a class if an element 
                        does not have it already, and remove the class if it does have it. 
                        It returns true if the class was added and false if it was removed.

    <pre>
        heroes4.classList.toggle('hero'); // will add the 'hero' class
        console.log(heroes4.className);

        heroes4.classList.toggle('hero'); // will remove the 'hero' class
        console.log(heroes4.className);
    </pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        the document.getElementsByClassName() and document.getElementsByTagName() methods are
                        live collections that will update to reflect any changes on the page. <br>
                        Hence can be useful when creating nav bars that change when clicked on.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Creating Dynamic Markup</h4>
                    <p>
                      The DOM can be used to create new elements and add them to the page, 
                      as well as edit elements that already exist and remove any unwanted elements
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Methods used include: createElement(),createTextNode(),appendChild() and 
                        textContent property.Other methods are removeChild() and insertBefore().
                        The following is the process of creating a new element dynamically.<br>
                        Create the element node, Create the text node then Append the text node to the element node.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Function that creates elements dynamically</h4>
                    <p>
                        The following function can be used to create HTML elements dynamically.
    <pre>
        The function takes in the tag of the element to be created and the text
        content to be filled in the element as the two arguments

        function createElement (tag,text) {
            const el = document.createElement(tag);
            el.textContent = text;
            return el;
        }
    </pre>
                    </p>


                    <h4>InnerHTML</h4>

                    <p>
                        It returns all the child elements of an element as a string of HTML.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The innerHTML property is also writable and can be used to place a chunk of HTML
                        inside an element. This will replace all of a nodes children with the raw HTML 
                        contained in the string.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Using the DOM to update CSS for HTML elements</h4>
                    <p>
                       Every element linked/created in JShas a style property. This can be used to
                        dynamically modify the presentation of any element on a web page.
        <pre>
        const heroes = document.getElementById('roster');
        const superman = heroes.children[0];

        superman.style.border = "red 2px solid";
        </pre>

                    <h3><em>Event Listeners</em></h3>

                    <p>
                    Events are another part of the DOM. They provide a link (or an interface)
                    between the web page and user interactions.<br>
                    <b>Event Listeners are what users use/interact with to see how
                     interactive a webpage/website is.Its what programmers use to add attach
                     dynamic changes and these come inform of clicks or pressing a key.
                    </b>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Event listeners are added to elements on the page and are part of the DOM.
                        The recommended way of dealing with events, and the current standard, 
                        is to use event listeners.<br>
                        The addEventListener() method is used to attach an event to a DOM element.
                        
<pre>
    document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);

    Its first parameter is the type of event, and 
    the second is a callback function that is invoked when the event occur

    Note that the parentheses are not placed after the function when it's used as the 
    argument to an event listener -doSomething- no (), otherwise, the function will 
    actually be called when the event listener is set, instead of when the event happens!
</pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, 
                    pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect 
                    and then respond to.
                    <p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Every time a button/page/element is clicked, a callback function is called. 
                        So the program can continue processing the rest of the code while it is waiting 
                        for the click event to happen.

    <pre>
        document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);
        
        In the example above, the event listener has been added to the documents 
        body element. It will call the function doSomething() when any part of the 
        page is clicked on
        
    </pre>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Common Events</h4>
                    <p>
                      Click Event,
                        <br>
                       <b>Avoid inline event handlers : onclick="console.log('You Clicked Me!')"</b>
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Event Object</h4>
                    <p>    
                      Whenever an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function is called.
                      <b>This function is automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains
                      information about the event.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The type property of the event object is used to tell us the type of event.<br>
                        The target property returns a reference to the node that fired the event
                        <pre>
        function doSomething(event){
        console.log(event.type);
        console.log(event.target);
        }

        addEventListener('click', doSomething);
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Types of Events</h3>
                    <h4>Mouse Events</h4>
                    <p>
                      click event that occurs when a mouse button is clicked, the mousedown
                      and mouseup events occur before a click event is fired,dblclick event(do not use click
                      and double click on the same element),
                    </p>
                    <h4>Keyboard Events</h4>
                    <p>
                       Three events that occur when a user presses a key are: keydown, keypress and keyup. 
                       When a user presses a key, the events occur in that order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The keydown event occurs when a key is pressed and will continue to occur if 
                      the key is held down.The keypress event occurs after a keydown event but before
                      a keyup event. The keypress event only occurs for keys that produce character input (plus the 'Delete' key). This means that it’s the most reliable way to find out the character that was pressed on the keyboard.
                       The keyup event occurs when a key is released.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       To understand the differences in these events, it is important to distinguish 
                       between a physical key on the keyboard and a character that appears on the screen. 
                       The keydown event is the action of pressing a key, whereas the keypress event is
                        the action of a character being typed on the screen.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Touch Events</h4>
                    <p>
                      Many modern devices now support touch events. These are used on smartphones and 
                      tablets, as well as touch-screen monitors, satellite navigators and trackpads. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The touchstart event occurs when a user initially touches the surface,
                       The click event can be thought of as a "tap" in the context of a touch event.
                       (has delay of 300ms),The touchend event occurs when a user stops touching the surface,
                       The touchmove event occurs after a user has touched the screen then moves around 
                       without leaving,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are no 'swipe' events. These need to be created by using a combination of
                         touchstart, touchmove, and touchleave events that monitor the distance and
                        direction moved from start to finish of a touch event
                    </p>
                    <h4>Stopping Default Behavior</h4>
                    <p>
                      Some elements have default behavior associated with certain events. For example, 
                      when a user clicks on a link, the browser redirects to the address in the href
                      attribute and a form is submitted when the user clicks on the Submit button.
                      <b>
                        preventDefault() is a method of the event object that can be used inside the callback 
                        function to stop the default behavior happening.
                      </b>  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Event Propagation</h4>
                    <p>
                       When you click on an element, you are actually clicking on all the elements it is
                       nested inside of. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you click on one of the -li- elements, you are also clicking on the 
                        -ul-, -body- and -html- elements. 
                        An event is said to propagate as it moves from one element to another.
                        <b>
                            Event propagation is the order that the events fire on each element. 
                            There are two forms of event propagation: bubbling and capturing.
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Bubbling is when the event fires on the element clicked on first, then bubbles up 
                      the document tree, firing an event on each parent element until it reaches the root 
                      node.Capturing starts by firing an event on the root element, then propagates 
                      downwards, firing an event on each child element until it reaches the target element
                      that was clicked on.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Third argument of the addEventListener() function - Capturing</h4>
                    <p>
                      <b>
                      Capturing: The addEventListener() method has a third parameter, which is a boolean
                      value that specifies whether capturing should be used or not. 
                      </b>
                      It defaults to false, which is why bubbling happens by default.
                      To implement capturing,add the third argument as a true boolean variable.
                      <pre>
                        ulElement.addEventListener('click', (event) =>
                        console.log('Clicked on ul'),true);

                        liElement.addEventListener('click', (event) =>
                        console.log('Clicked on li'),true);
                      </pre>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Event Delegation and Its main Application-use</h4>
                    <p>
                      Event delegation can be used to attach an event listener to a parent element in
                      order to capture events that are triggered by its child elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
                            A better way is to attach the event listener to the parent -ul- element, that has 
                            many li elements is to use the target property to identify the element that 
                            was clicked on
                        </b>
                    </p>
