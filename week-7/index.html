                      <h3><em>Further Functions</em></h3>
                      <p>
                        In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed around
                        in the same way as every other value. They can have their own properties and methods,
                        as well as accepting other functions as parameters and being returned by other functions.
                      </p>
                    </article>
                    
                    <!-- sub topic goes here -->
                    <article>
                       <h3><em>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</em></h3>
                       <p>
                        The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself,
                        but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an anonymous
                        function to a variable that has the same name as the function.
                       </p>

                       <h3>Recursive Functions</h3>
                       <p>
                        A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. 
                        It is a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved.
                       </p>

                       <h3>Event-driven Asynchronous Programming</h3>
                       <p>
                        Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming.
                        JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, which means only one piece of code will
                        ever be processed at a time.
                        This may seem like a limitation, but non-blocking techniques can be used to ensure that
                        the program continues to run. 
                        <b>Instead of waiting for an event to occur, a callback can be created that is invoked
                         when the event happens. This means that the code is able to run out of order, or asynchronously.
                        Events can be DOM events, such as the click and keyPress that we looked at in Chapter 7, 
                        but they can also be events such as the completion of a file download, data returned 
                        from a database, or the result of a complex operation.
                        </b>
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        By using callbacks, we ensure that waiting for these tasks to complete doesn't hold up
                        the execution of other parts of the program. Once the task has been completed, the 
                        callback will be invoked before returning to the rest of the program.
                       </p>

                       <h3>Promises</h3>
                       <p>
                        A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises don't do 
                        anything that can't already be achieved using callbacks, but they help simplify the
                        process, and avoid the convoluted code that can result from using multiple callbacks.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to be pending.
                        It remains in this state while the operation is taking place. At this stage, the promise
                        is said to be unsettled. Once the operation has completed, the promise is said to have been settled.
                        A settled promise can result in two different outcomes:
                        Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.
                        Rejected ― the asynchronous operation did not work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error.
                        Both these outcomes will return any relevant data, and you can take the appropriate action based on the outcome of the promise.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        Once a promise has been settled, the then() method can be used to deal with the outcome.
                        This method accepts two arguments. The first is a fulfillment function that is called 
                        when the promise is resolved. Any data returned from the resolve() function will be 
                        passed along to this function. The second argument is a rejection function that is called
                        if the promise is rejected. Similar to the fulfillment function, the rejection function
                        receives any data returned from the reject() function.
                       </p>

                       <h3>Async Functions</h3>
                       <p>
                        These functions are preceded by the async keyword and allow you to write asynchronous 
                        code as if it was synchronous. This is achieved by using the await operator before an 
                        asynchronous function.
                       </p>

                       <h3>Closures</h3>
                       <p>
                        A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another
                        function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        A closure is formed when a function returns another function that then maintains access to
                        any variables created in the original functions scope.
                       </p>

                       <h3>Pure Functions</h3>
                       <p><b>
                        A key aspect of functional programming is its use of pure functions. 
                        A pure function is a function that adheres to the following rules:
                        1.The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as 
                        arguments. It doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program.
                        2.There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change any values or data elsewhere 
                        in the program. It only makes non-destructive data transformations and returns new values, 
                        rather than altering any of the underlying data.
                        3.Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will always 
                        return the same result.</b>
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        In order to follow these rules, any pure function must have:
                        At least one argument; otherwise the return value must depend on something other than the
                        arguments of the function, breaking the first rule.
                        A return value; otherwise there is no point in the function (unless it has changed 
                        something else in the program, in which case, it is broken the 'no side-effects' rule).
                       </p>

                       <h3>Higher-Order Functions</h3>
                       <p>
                        Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or 
                        return another function as a result, or both.
                        Closures are used extensively in higher-order functions as they allow us to create a 
                        generic function that can be used to then return more specific functions based on 
                        its arguments.

                        <h3><em>Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)</em></h3>
                        <p>
                         <b>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server</b>,
                         and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent 
                         and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in 
                         response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                          Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client.
                          The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML
                          rather than a whole web page.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Ajax enables JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server,
                          allowing content to be updated in real time.
                        </p>

                        <h4>No more XML, now we using JSON!</h4>
                        <p>
                          When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to return data. 
                          But by far the most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is JSON, 
                          which is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML. 
                          <b>Ajaj is sometimes used to describe the technique,using JSON in place of XML</b>
                          JSON also has the advantage of being natively supported in JavaScript, so you can deal 
                          with JavaScript objects rather than having to parse XML files using DOM methods.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With Ajax,users can see new content on web pages without having to refresh the page. 
                            Shopping baskets can be updated in the background, 
                            partial page content can be loaded seamlessly, and photo galleries can dynamically 
                            load images.
                            Today, it is unusual for Ajax not to be used when a partial web page update is required.
                        </p>

                        <h4>API</h4>
                        <p>
                            An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external
                            access to another program or service. These methods are owned by big websites that provide
                            their data (to other websites) using these methods.These websites allow controlled access
                            to their data via public APIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A weather site, for example, might have an API that provides methods that return
                            information about the weather in a given location, such as temperature, wind speed,
                            and so on. This can then be used to display local weather data on a web page of another
                            website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The information that is returned by APIs is often serialized as JSON. Since the data is
                            being provided by an external site, CORS will have to be enabled in order to access
                            information from an API.Some services may also require authentication in order to 
                            access their APIs.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Fetch API</h4>
                        <p>
                            Fetch API, is currently a living standard for requesting and sending data 
                            asynchronously across a network. The Fetch API uses promises to avoid callback hell.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument,
                             which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch. 
                             fetch() method returns a promise that resolves to the response returned from the URL that
                             was provided as an argument.
                             Because it is a promise, we can also use a catch statement at the end to deal with any
                             errors that may occur.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Fetch API introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that is 
                            returned when the promise is fulfilled.
                            Each response object has an ok property that checks to see if the response is successful.
                            The promise will only be rejected in the case of a network error, rather than something
                            like a '404 page not found error', which is still considered a successful request
                             in terms of the promise.
                        </p>

                        <h4>JSON Responses</h4>
                        <p>
                            JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used 
                            to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves
                            to a JavaScript object.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h4>
                        <p>
                           The Web is built upon the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. When a client
                           (usually a browser) makes a request to a server, it contains information about 
                           which HTTP verb to use. HTTP verbs, also known as HTTP methods are the what HTTP 
                           uses to tell the server what type of request is being made, which then determines
                           the server will deal with the request.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The five most commonly used verbs when dealing with resources on the web are:
                            GET requests to retrieve resources
                            POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task
                            PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely
                            PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource
                            DELETE requests to delete a resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HTTP is a part of a browser request that holds the type of request being made and
                            and tells it to the server(using a an HTTP method) so the server can know exactly how
                            to respond to the request being made.
