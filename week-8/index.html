                    <!-- sub topic goes here -->
                    <article>
                      <h3><em>Transforms</em></h3>
                      <p>
                        The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you <b>translate, scale rotate, scale, and/or skew any
                        element on the page.</b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces)
                        that will be applied in the order they're provided.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Translation</h4>
                      <p>
                        Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. 
                        When you employ a translation function, you're moving elements without impacting 
                        the flow of the document.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top.
                        If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the 
                        translateX() or translateY() functions respectively.
                        Transforms dont work on inline elements. But that's easy enough to fix. We'll just
                        add display: inline-block; to our span:
                      </p>

                      <h4>Scaling</h4>
                      <p>
                        The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then 
                        vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values,
                        growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original
                        aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2)
                        would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As with translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions.
                        A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center; in other 
                        words, the elements center will stay in the same place as its dimensions change. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Note that you shouldn't declare a new transform: because of the cascade, a second 
                        transform would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a 
                        space-separated list of transform functions. We simply add our scale to the end of
                        that space-separated list.
                        NOTE also:Using the scale function on inline text can have unwanted results.Use it
                        more on block elements.then arrangement of text wont be affected much.
                        Transforms are applied in the order provided and The order of transform functions does
                        matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the 
                        rotated axis.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Rotation</h4>
                      <p>
                        The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle
                        value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the elements center. Generally,
                        angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative 
                        moving counterclockwise. 
                      </p>

                      <h4>Skew</h4>
                      <p>
                        The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you'd expect, the 
                        x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. 
                        If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis.
                      </p>

                       <h3><em>Transitions</em></h3>
                       <p>
                        <b>
                          Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing
                          simple animations. For example, if a link changes color on hover, you can have it 
                          gradually fade from one color to the other instead of a sudden change. 
                        </b>
                         They're both transitions, but with the CSS transition property the color transition can
                         be gradual.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        NOTE:With transitions
                        It is important to include a pre-state and a post-state. For example, to transition 
                        from rectangular corners to rounded corners, set the original state to
                        border-radius: 0;And In itself, the transition-property property has no effect; that's 
                        because we still need to specify the duration of the transition.
                        <b>
                            200ms (0.2s) is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything 
                            slower will make the website seem slow, drawing generally unwanted attention to what 
                            was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything faster may be too subtle.
                        </b>
                       </p>
                    </article>

                     <article>
                       <h3><em>Animations</em></h3>
                       <p>
                        <b>
                           Transitions animate elements over time; however, they're limited in what they can do.
                           CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via
                           keyframes.
                        </b>
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition. 
                        With CSS transitions, we're essentially limited to defining a first and a last keyframe.
                        CSS animations allow us to add any number of keyframes in between, to guide our animation
                        in more complex ways.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                          Use animations and transitions where it makes sense, enhancing the user experienceâ€”and 
                          skip it everywhere else.
