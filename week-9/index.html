                    <h2>The Document Object Model(DOM)</h2>

                    <!-- sub topic goes here -->
                    <article>
                      <h3><em>DOM</em></h3>
                      <p>
                        The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable
                        interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content
                        and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.
                        <b>
                          The DOM represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like
                          structure.
                          We can use JavaScript to access and modify different parts of a web page using a special
                          built-in object called document.
                        </b>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Node lists are array-like objects, but they are not arrays. You can access each item
                        using index notation. For example, document.images[0] will return the first image in 
                        the node list of all the images in the document.
                        They also have a length property, which can be used to iterate through every element
                        using a for loop, like so.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Common Methods used to access Elements</h4>
                      <p>
                        Common methods used to access Elements on a web page include
                        <b>
                            getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByClassName(), 
                            document.querySelector() method (allows you to use CSS notation to find the first
                            element in the document that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument),
                            document.querySelectorAll()
                        </b>
                      </p>

                      <h4>Getting and Setting Attributes</h4>
                      <p> 
                        All HTML elements have a large number of possible attributes such as 'class', 'id',
                         src, and 'href'. 
                         The DOM has numerous getter and setter methods that can be used to view, add, remove or 
                         modify the value of any of these attributes.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        These methods include :
                        The getAttribute() method which returns the value of the attribute provided as an argument.
                        The setAttribute can change the value of an element's attributes. It takes two arguments:
                        the attribute that you wish to change, and the new value of that attribute.
                        If an element does not have an attribute, the setAttribute method can be used to add it to the element.
                      </p>

                      <h4>The classList Property</h4>
                      <p>
                        The classList property is a list of all the classes an element has. It has a number of
                        methods that make it easier to modify the class of an element.These include 
                        classList.add() and classList.remove(), classList.toggle() and classList.contains methods;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The toggle method is a particularly useful method that will add a class if an element 
                        doesn't have it already, and remove the class if it does have it. It returns true if 
                        the class was added and false if it was removed. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The contains method will check to see if an element has a particular class:
                      </p>

                      <h4>Creating Dynamic Markup</h4>
                      <p>Following are steps to follow when creating a new element with text content 
                        1.Create the element node 2.Create the text node
                        3.Append the text node to the element node
                      </p>

                      <h4>A Function To Create Elements</h4>
                      <p>
                        <pre>
                            function createElement (tag,text) {
                                const el = document.createElement(tag);
                                el.textContent = text;
                                return el
                            }
                        </pre>

                        The insertBefore() method will place a new element before another element in the markup.
                        It's important to note that this method is called on the parent node. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        An element can be removed from a page using the removeChild() method. This method is 
                        called on the parent node and has a single parameter, which is the node to be removed
                      </p>

                      <h4>innerHTML property</h4>
                      <p>
                        It returns all the child elements of an element as a string of HTML. If an element 
                        contains lots of other elements, all the raw HTML is returned. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The power of the innerHTML property becomes even more apparent if you want to insert
                        a large amount of HTML into the document. Instead of creating each element and text 
                        node individually, you can simply enter the raw HTML as a string. The relevant nodes
                        will then be added to the DOM tree automatically.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Updating CSS using DOM</h4>
                      <p>
                        Every element node has a style property. This can be used to dynamically modify the 
                        presentation of any element on a web page.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Any CSS property names that are separated by dashes must be written in camelCase 
                        notation, so the dash is removed and the next letter is capitalized because dashes are
                        not legal characters in property names.
                        For example, the CSS property background-color becomes backgroundColor
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        One particularly useful CSS property often employed is the display property.
                        This can be used to make elements disappear and reappear on the page as needed by 
                        changing from display:block to display:none
                      </p>

                      <p><b>NOTE: Using dynamic css styling</b>
                      While it may seem useful to be able to edit the styles of elements on the fly like this,
                      it is much better practice to dynamically change the class of an element and keep the
                      relevant styles for each class in a separate stylesheet.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <pre>
                        Instead of using 
                        
                        superman.style.border('red 2px solid');

                        A better alternative would be to add a class of 'highlighted':

                        superman.classList.add('highlighted');

                        And then add the following CSS in a separate stylesheet file:

                          .highlighted{
                              border: red 2px solid;
                          }
                          </pre>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This would give more flexibility if it was later decided to change the look of the 
                        highlighted elements. It could simply be changed at the CSS level, rather than having 
                        to dig around in the JavaScript code. 
                      </p>

                       <h3><em>HTML5 APIs </em></h3>

                       <h4>The data- Attribute</h4>
                       <p>
                        <b>
                          The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes
                          that are ignored by the browser.
                          The data- attribute gives more direct information about an element as they 
                          provide a convenient way of adding data directly into the HTML markup
                          data- attributes have a sole purpose of being used by a JavaScript program.
                          This means they're perfect for adding data on an element that can be used as a hook 
                          that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.
                        </b>
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        The name of data- attributes must alway start with data- and can
                        contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.
                        They can also include an optional string value.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        Good examples include: data-dropdown  and data-rating = '5' 
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        <b>The information contained in the attributes can be used to identify particular elements.
                          And The values of the attributes can also be used to filter different elements.
                        </b>
                        For example, all the elements with an attribute of data-dropdown could be identified 
                        as dropdown menu.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                        <b>
                          Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains.
                        </b>
