// JS-Prototypal Inheritance
// JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model. This means that every class has a
// prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or 
// methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that class.
class Turtle {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.weapon = 'hands';
    }
    sayHi(){
        return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`;
    }
    // attack(){
    //     return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;
    // }
}

// creating a turtle instance
const leo = new Turtle('Leonardo');
console.log(leo);
console.log(leo.name);
console.log(leo.sayHi());
//console.log(leo.attack());

// The prototype property of the class is used to augment/add the class with extra methods 
// and properties after it has been created.

// adding a property/variable and method to the Turtle class using the prototype class
// property/attribute
Turtle.prototype.weapon = 'Hands';

Turtle.prototype.attack = function(){
       return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;
}

// Now if we create a new Turtle instance, we can see that it inherits the weapon property
// and attack() method from the Turtle.prototype object, as well as receiving the name 
// property and sayHi() method from the class declaration.

const raph = new Turtle('Raphael');

raph.name
// << 'Raphael'

raph.sayHi()
// << 'Hi dude, my name is Raphael'

raph.weapon
console.log(raph.weapon);
// << 'Hands'

raph.attack()
console.log(raph.attack());
// << 'Feel the power of my Hands!'

// The prototype object is live, so if a new property or method is added to the prototype,
// any instances of its class will inherit the new properties and methods automatically,
// even if that instance has already been created.

// Overwriting Prototype Properties
// An object instance can overwrite any properties or methods inherited from its prototype
// by simply assigning a new value to them. For example, we can give our turtles their own
// weapon properties

leo.weapon = 'Katana Blades';
// << 'Katana Blades';

// What Should the Prototype Be Used For?
// The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has
// been declared. It should be used to define any properties that will remain the same
// for every instance of the class.

// A golden rule to remember is: Never use arrays or objects as a default value in 
// prototype.
// This is not a problem if arrays or objects are set as default values from within the
// constructor function in the class declaration.

// NOTE:Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to the class declaration
// after it’s been defined can be added to the prototype. These will be added to all 
// instances, even those that have already been created.


// PUBLIC AND PRIVATE METHODS
//Avoid objects that are public facing ― giving users or external services too much access
// to properties and methods, could be a recipe for disaster!
class Turtle2 {
    constructor(name,color) {
        this.name = name;
        let _color = color;

        this.setColor = (color) => {
            if(typeof color === 'string'){
                return _color = color;
                } else {
                    throw new Error('Color must be a string');

raph2.getColor();
// << 'Red'

// raph2.setColor(4);
// << Error: Color must be a string - This way access & modification to private data is
// controlled

// The _color property is created as a variable inside the scope of the constructor 
// function inside the class declaration. This makes it impossible to access outside
// of this scope. The getColor() and setColor() methods are known as getter and setter 
// methods and they form a closure over this variable and provide controlled access to
// the property instead:

//INHERITANCE USING extends KEYWORD

    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;

        return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`;
    }

    swim() {
        return `${this.name} paddles in the water`;
    }
}

//Inheritance in action
class NinjaTurtle extends Turtle {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name);
        this.weapon = 'hands';
        // the keyword super refers to the parent class, and can be used to access any
        // properties and call any methods of the parent class.
        // Here its used to call the constructor function of the Turtle class.
    }
    attack() { return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!` } 
}


// CREATING OBJECTS FROM OTHER OBJECTS
// The Object() constructor function has a method called create that can be used to create
// a new object that is an exact copy of the object that is provided as an argument
// The object that is provided as the argument acts as the prototype for the new object.

// This will act as the prototype for all other Human objects. 
const Human = {
    arms: 2,
    legs: 2,
    walk() { console.log('Walking'); }
}

// Creating an instance of Human using the Object.create() method that inherits all the 
//properties and methods from the Human object.
const lois = Object.create(Human);

lois.arms
// << 2

lois.legs
// << 2

lois.walk()
// << Walking

// Extra properties can then be added to each instance using assignment
lois.name = 'Lois Lane';
// << 'Lois Lane'

lois.job = 'Reporter';
// << 'Reporter'

// It’s often easier to create the object, then add each new property one by one. 
// This can be made quicker using the mixin() function that is covered later.

// Object-Based Inheritance
const Superhuman = Object.create(Human);

Superhuman.name = 'Name Needed';
Superhuman.realName = 'Real Name Needed';

// no extends used,just add new attributes and methods to the new instance which acts as
// a class as well and can be used to create other objects.
Superhuman.change = function() {
    return `${this.realName} goes into a phone box and comes out as ${this.name}!`;
};

// Now we can use the Superhuman object as a prototype to create more objects based on it
const superman = Object.create(Superhuman);

// Once a Superhuman object has been created, we can overwrite the default properties by
// assignment:
superman.name = 'Superman';
superman.realName = 'Clark Kent';

// Now we can see that it has inherited the change() method from the Superhuman object:
superman.change()
//<< Clark Kent goes into a phone box and comes out as Superman!
