                    <h2>Forms, OOP</h2>

                    <!-- sub topic goes here -->
                    <article>
                      <h3><em>Forms</em></h3>
                      <p>
                        Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Forms are made up of a -form- element that contains form controls such as input fields,
                        select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that 
                        is processed once the form has been submitted.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It is possible, and becoming more and more common, to process the information in a 
                        form on the -front end- before it is sent to the server using JavaScript, which is 
                        what will be focusing on in this chapter.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Accessing Form Elements</h4>
                      <p>
                        The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML 
                        collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup.
                        Even though there is only one form in our example, a collection will still be
                        returned, so we have to use index notation to return the first (and only) 
                        form object.-- const form = document.forms[0];  --<br>
                        This is the equivalent of using the following method 
                        -- const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0]; --
                        or using the name attribute of the form
                        -- const form = document.forms.search; -- and const form = document.forms['search']; --preferred way --
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all
                        the elements contained in the form. These may include an input element and a button element:
                        -- const [input,button] = form.elements; -- <br>
                        Form controls can be also accessed using their --name-- attributes as if it was a 
                        property of the form object.
                        -- const input = form.searchInput -- or -- const input = form['searchInput'] --
                      </p>

                      <h4>Form Properties and Methods</h4>
                      <p>
                        Form objects have a number of useful properties and methods that can be used to 
                        interact with the form.These include form.submit,form.reset and form.action.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Form Events</h4>
                      <p>
                          Main form event include focus(triggered when an element is focused),
                          blur(occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element),
                          change(occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it),
                          submit(occurs when the form is submitted)  .
                      </p>

                      <h4>Submitting a Form</h4>
                      <p>
                        Possibly the most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is
                        submitted. Usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be 
                        processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it is sent by 
                        adding a submit event listener.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Form Validation</h4>
                      <p>
                        Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly. 
                        Examples of the types of validation that occur include ensuring that:A required field is completed
                        An email address is valid,A number is entered when numerical data is required,
                        A password is at least a minimum number of characters
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the server side. 
                        It is advisable to use both client-side and server-side validation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                         JavaScript should not be relied upon to validate any data before it is saved to a 
                         database. This is because it is possible for a user to modify the JavaScript code 
                         and bypass the validation rules. It's also very easy to bypass the front-end 
                         completely and send arbitrary data to the application's backend. 
                         <b>
                          For these reasons,JavaScript validation (on front-end) should be used to enhance the
                          user experience when filling in a form by giving feedback about any errors before
                          it is submitted.
                         </b>

                       <h3><em>Object Oriented Programming - OOP</em></h3>
                       <p>
                        <b></b>
                        There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
                        Encapsulation involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making
                        methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing
                        to know how it is done.<br>
                        Polymorphism involves objects having to share the same method, but also having the 
                        ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.<br>
                        Inheritance involves taking an object that already exists and inheriting all its 
                        properties and methods.Then improve on its functionality by adding new properties
                        and methods.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        <b>NOTE ON CLASSES:</b>
                        Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known as class-based languages.
                        This is because they use a class to define a blueprint for an object.
                        Objects are then created as an instance of that class, and inherit all the properties and
                        methods of the class.<br>
                        JavaScript didn't have classes before ES6, <b>and used the concept of using actual objects
                        as the blueprint for creating more objects. This is known as a prototype-based language.</b>
                        Even though ES6 now supports classes, it still uses this prototypal inheritance model in
                        the background.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Objects can be created using a constructor method.
                        <b>Objects created using the literal notation& class do not reference its methods and 
                          methods with this key word when creating the object BUT using the constructor method,
                          this keyword is used to make reference to the object variables and methods when 
                          creating the object.And also,when constructor is used,the name of the object-class needs
                          to start with an uppercase.<br>
                          In ES6 this keyword is used to make reference to the object variables inside the constructor
                          when creating a JS class
                        </b>
                          <pre>
                      Creating an object using literal notation
                        
                      const dice = {
                          sides: 6,
                          roll() {
                              return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                          }    
                      }
                      

                      Creating an object-class using a constructor

                      const Dice = function(sides=6){
                          this.sides = sides;
                          this.roll = function() {
                          return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                          }
                      }

          The keyword this is used to represent the object that will be returned
          by the constructor function.

          Before ES6, constructor functions were the only way of achieving class-like
          behavior in JavaScript.

                        ES6 Class Declarations

                        class Dice2 {
                            constructor(sides=6) {
                                this.sides = sides;
                            }

                            roll() {
                                return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                            }
                        }
                          </pre>
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The class declaration syntax works in exactly the same way as the constructor function 
                        syntax, because it is actually just syntactic sugar that is implemented in the same way
                        in the background.<br>
                        The ES6 class declarations are preferable to the constructor function syntax because 
                        they are more succinct, easier to read and all code in a class definition is 
                        implicitly in strict mode, so doesn't need the 'use strict' statement. 
                       </p>

                       <h4>Built-In Constructor Functions</h4>
                       <p>
                        JavaScript contains a number of built-in constructor functions such as Object, Array,
                        and Function that can be used to create objects, arrays and functions instead of 
                        literals.<br>
                        The easiest way to create a new object is to use the literal syntax<br>
                        const literalObject = {}; OR constructedObject = new Object(); -with constructor
                       </p>

                       <h4>Static methods</h4>
                       <p>
                        The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method. 
                        These are sometimes called class methods in other programming languages. 
                        A static method is called by the class directly rather than by instances of the class.
                        <br>
                        Static methods are only called on actual classes and are not available to instances of 
                        the class.Example,Dice as the class name<br>
                        Dice.description()
                       </p>

                       <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
                       <p>
                        The concept of polymorphism means that different objects can have the same method,
                        but implement it in different ways.<br>
                        The toString() method is a good demonstration of polymorphism, since different objects
                        have the same method but implement it differently. The advantage of this is that 
                        higher-level functions are able to call a single method, even though it may be
                        implemented in various ways
                       </p>

                       <h4>Creating Objects from Other Objects</h4>
                       <p>
                        It is possible to avoid using classes altogether, and create new objects based on 
                        another object that acts as a 'blueprint' or prototype instead.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The Object() constructor function has a method called create that can be used to create 
                        a new object that is an exact copy of the object that is provided as an argument. 
                        The object that is provided as the argument acts as the prototype for the new object.
                       </p>
